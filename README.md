# Dijkstra
Implementation of the Dijkstra algortihm used to find the shortest route between nodes on a graph.

The graph can be created using the script or it can be readed from a File like the included one.  

The implementation works simulating the table method to use the Dijkstra algorithm, so, in fact, all the shortest routes to any node on the graph are calculated and could be displayed.
